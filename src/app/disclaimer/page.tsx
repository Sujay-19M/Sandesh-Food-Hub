        <p>
            Sandesh Food Hub makes every attempt to identify ingredients that may cause allergic reactions for those with food allergies. Effort is made to instruct our food production staff on the severity of food allergies. However, there is always a risk of contamination.
        </p>
        <p>
            We use products containing nuts, soy, milk, eggs, and wheat. While we take steps to minimize risk and safely handle the foods that contain potential allergens, please be advised that cross-contamination may occur, as factors beyond our reasonable control may alter the formulations of the food we serve, or manufacturers may change their formulations without our knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please inform your server of any food allergies. We will do our best to accommodate your needs.
